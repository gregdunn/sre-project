This will provision a VPC with a single server running ELK stack behind and ELB with a self-signed cert.

Not done:  password protect Kibana, clustered environment, multi-az with public/private subnets and private elb for elasticsearch. 

Initial setup:

1. cd to terraform directory

2. Edit the file variables.tf file and put in the full path to your public ssh key for the value:  public_key_path

3. Set environment variables in shell for:  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

4. Generate self-signed cert:  “sh gencert.sh”

5. terraform init

Now you can:

terraform plan
terraform apply
