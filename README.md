# Build a local infrastructure

Your task is to create a local fully automated infrastructure using the following tools: 

- Ansible 
- Vagrant

This should identify your abilities to build an infrastructure from scratch using automated tools, and your abilities as a systems administrator.

### Requirements:
Your task is to create a highly available two node cluster running a web application of your choice. The application must have a persistent store which will be shared by the nodes.   

This will be fronted by Nginx, and the entrypoint into the cluster should be from port 443. A self-signed certificate should be used on the listener.

Be security conscious. 

### The Solution:
A well thought out project, with emphasis on readability and maintainability. We expect that we should be able to run your setup locally.

### Steps:
1) Fork this repository, and solve on your fork
2) When completed, send an email to your contact with a link to your completed example
